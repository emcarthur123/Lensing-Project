Note: This repo is a temploate on establishing how you can go about querying DESI <br/>
and how a training sample may be created. If you plan on running it id recommend <br/>
you look at the section below. <br/>

# Running
* Make sure you have the following packages installed.
  * Astropy
  * Matplotlib
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * DataLab (https://datalab.noirlab.edu/docs/manual/UsingAstroDataLab/InstallDatalab/InstallDatalab/InstallDatalab.html#install-using-pip)
  * PyQSOfit (https://nbviewer.org/github/legolason/PyQSOFit/blob/master/example/example.ipynb)
 
# Note on Desi:
You will not be able to query unless you partially install DESI Targeting. So I'd <br/>
recommend you install DESI using the setup.py method ONLY theres no need to follow the steps that follow after that.
